            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WITH all due Reſpect to your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Dignity, I make bold to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, that laſt Market-day I bought your Book, and have ſince <hi>read it without prejudice;</hi> and am glad to find that a Man of your ſide, though he makes no Abatements in his Wit, uſes ſo great <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> in his Arguments. I am willing to think I have done what you never did; for I have really conſider'd your Book, which had you done who live within the Air of the Court, and muſt needs be infected with good breeding, you had doubtleſs retrenched divers Paſſages, that are full enough of Wit, <hi>(you'll</hi> ſay) but not quite ſo full of good Manners. In ſhort, Sir, had you conſider'd, you had never printed; and however at other times <hi>the Burthen of Writing may</hi>

               <hi>have lain upon your Shoulders,</hi> you would for once have conſider'd upon whoſe Shoulders the <hi>Burthen of Reading</hi> was to lie. For my own part I deſign to do this, and ſhall therefore draw up what I have to ſay, in as little compaſs as I can; for, as

               <hi>Horace</hi> ſays upon the like Occaſion, ſhould I too long interrupt your Care of your thirty thouſand, how could I anſwer it to the Pariſh?</p>
            <p>To begin therefore, I agree with you, that Indifferent Things are in their own nature alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and even a <hi>Country Divine</hi> may gather from the Rubric, that Ceremonies are ſuch Indifferent Things. 'Tis an acknowledg'd Truth, and will be ſo, though you prov'd it in ſix pages more: Wherefore if you pleaſe well take it for granted, and go on to the main Point, which is, making Alterations at this time: Of this you give us your Senſe in divers Places; I wiſh you would pleaſe to reconcile 'em. For our Weſtern Underſtandings cannot ſo readily comprehend, how <hi>the Reaſon of a</hi>

                  <hi>p.</hi> 2.</note> Paſſages conſiſt, and you ſhall have my Vote to be Chairman in the next Committee of Union. But ſince you allow ſo graciouſly that Good and Wiſe Men may differ, pray why ſo hard upon the Good Men, that are not of the Wiſe Mens Opinion? Muſt we needs be kick'd out of Church, if we like the Eſtabliſh'd Liturgy? and away to <hi>Bealam for cool and ſober thoughts?</hi> Is there no uſe of <note place="margin">

            <p>It were to be wiſh'd too, that the Wiſe Men would a little adjuſt their Notions for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of us Country-men, who are now perplex'd with their different Sentiments, as bad as Judge <hi>A—</hi>was, when the Lawyer ſpake for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.

But you forget, Sir, one main point of Country Wiſdom, which is this, That we never make Pies without Paper to put under 'em; and therefore your Book coming ſo very opportunely, my Maid went cheerfully to Baking. As for Brewing, you ſay well, that we always do it in hopes ſome honeſt Man may be the better for't; for do you think, I'd have brew'd laſt <hi>March,</hi> had I thought the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters were to drink it this <hi>February?</hi> The drink would never have work'd, Man. But how come you to be ſo knowing in our Country Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? <hi>Tu regere imperio,</hi> as the Poet has it; Do you mind Beef, and <hi>Whitechappel,</hi> and ſet up your Pillars at thoſe Bars: You may keep a few Hens (inſtead of Fathers) in your Cockloft, to learn

how to reckon your Chickens; but as ever you hope to have a Dignity, not a word of Ale or Union.</p>
            <p>You ſee, Sir, how forward we Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are to get into the City faſhion. You give us the Laws of Writing, and your Example muſt be our Apology, if we endeavor to trace your ſteps. We do it, as becomes us, with a <hi>Longe ſequere</hi>—preſerving the due diſtance between a poor Country Vicar, and one <hi>that drinks Sack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is a great Condeſcenſion in you after all your ſharpneſs, to ſubmit to that Country Method you have railled, though at laſt you graciouſly do it, and conſider both the End and Means. Your End, it ſeems, is bringing in Diſſenters, and your Means, Abatements and Alterations, and for theſe you give us two notable Reaſons; 1. That the Church may be clean. 2. That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may be trim. That the Church may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152739:5"/>
clean, 'tis plain; for you mean not to cleanſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>The Pillars;</hi> but only to <hi>take down the old Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,</hi> and <hi>ſweep away a few old Cobwebs, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>

I hope you don't mean the Kings Arms by your Eſcocheon, but ſome old Barons that has <hi>Nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus mutare leges Angliae</hi> for the Motto. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we take down this Eſcocheon, will you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us againſt the Court of Honor? or will any man elſe ſecure us that you won't take down the Commandments too? Theſe things ought to be conſider'd the rather, becauſe, your Cobwebs ſeem to glance at the Lawn Sleeves, and I wou'd not have them turn'd into Scotch-Cloath; but for a new Gallery, I am ready to pay my Proportion as ſoon as 'tis agreed how to place it to account.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152739:5"/>
Old Teſtament <hi>Jew</hi> would ſooner loſe his Head than marr the corner of his Beard. But that <note place="margin">Lev. ix 27.</note> grave Ceremony being long ſince antiquated, you preſume Religion may now ſend for a Barber; with all my heart, Sir, provided it be not <hi>Hanun,</hi>

                  <hi>p.</hi> 20.</note> and your Cap would become you much better, if it were not for your Habit.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, if you will pardon this Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we'll have done with your Means, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152739:6"/>
imagine a ſhort Dialogue between us concerning your End; to ſee what Benefits we may hope for when the Church is ſwept, and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>Sir, when the Church is ſwept, and ſo forth, the Diſſenters (who you know are a nice People, and affect an extraordinary Cleanlineſs in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) will come in like the ſeven Spirits in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. They would have come in before but they wanted a <hi>Gallery,</hi> and ſome <hi>odd inſignificant Figures</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> ſtar'd 'em full in the face, and frighted them; but now that the Church <hi>Walls</hi> are <hi>whited,</hi> welcome Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>I profeſs, Sir, I could never have imagin'd there would have come ſo many though; why here's ſuch a Multitude, one Church will never hold 'em: we muſt e'en ſubdivide, eſpecially ſome of the greater Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>Hold you there, Sir, it is not come to that yet. What, We divide that are for Union? You ſhall ſee I'll make room enough in my Church preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Avaunt <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> Take away the <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> I'll have none of thoſe <hi>Quakers.</hi> Look, Sir, here's <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 13.</note> a Flock of <hi>wild Diſſenters that can never be folded.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nay then we may e'en pull down the Gallery.</p>
            <p>Verily and ſo we might, if it were not for ſome <hi>gleanings of the Toleration,</hi> who are for a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church.</hi> They are but a few, Sir, and you ſee they are <hi>very grave:</hi> Pray let the Gallery ſtand,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152739:6"/>
'tis only for thoſe few; as for the <hi>ſtiff and peeviſh Diſſenters,</hi> Independents, and the reſt of thoſe <hi>inflexible, unchriſtian</hi> Fanaticks; if they ſet but one Foot in my Church-yard, I'll ring the Bells back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>Pray, Sir, How many do you think your <hi>Grave ones</hi> are?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About as many as the Alterations;</hi> for we poll'd <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note> 'em firſt, and quarrel'd with the Service accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>Did theſe Gentlemen ever apply to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation?</p>
            <p>No. <hi>And if they ſhould, I hope they know 'em</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>better than to truſt 'em.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, methinks, it is a hopeleſs Project to Unite with them we cannot truſt.</p>
            <p>Oh Lord! Why that's the very Reaſon of our <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 2.</note> Project. They have told us downright, that they won't be ſatisfied with any Alterations we can make; and do you think we would alter if we durſt truſt 'em?</p>
            <p>Explain your ſelf, I beſeech you.</p>
            <p>Why we know 'em for a parcel of Lying Knaves, that can never keep their Word; and therefore having caught 'em at declaring they won't come in, we are as ſure of 'em as if we had 'em in the Gallery.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:152739:7"/>
            <p>And when you have theſe Gentlemen, what do you intend to do with 'em?</p>
            <p>Do with 'em? there's a Queſtion! Preſent 'em to depriv'd Mens Livings; make 'em <hi>Convocation-Men to affront the Biſhops, ſtrengthen, enlarge, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>beautifie the beſt Church in the World with 'em.</hi> Theſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note> Fellows are fit for any thing.</p>
            <p>Much-good-de-ye, Sir, with your new Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And ſo much for imaginary Dialogue.</p>
            <p>To return to my Letter; You ſeem to have forgot one main thing when you altered your Church, and that was, to make up your Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Door; for it may ſo happen, that more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts may go out at that, than <hi>grave Diſſenters</hi> will come in at the other: ſeveral honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have told us ſo, and we know 'em ſo well that we dare truſt 'em; eſpecially ſince your Book is on their ſide: for when the Alterations take place, then they are the Diſſenters, and all your Arguments are on their ſide, and your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for <hi>altering</hi> will plead as ſtrongly for <hi>reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> what has been altered. So that here's the Old Judge again; and I ſee no way to get out of this Perplexity, but only the quiet Enjoyment of the Liturgy we have, and renouncing all Propoſals of changing for the ſake of Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>There are other Arguments that carry a fairer Appearance; as firſt, the Biſhops Promiſe. This
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152739:7"/>
the Parliament has effectually fulfill'd: a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the utmoſt the Diſſenters aim'd at: if you don't like that Favour, pray give it us again. But you add, <hi>There was a ſolemn Proteſtation,</hi> viz. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 28.</note> 
               <hi>a tacit Agreement among all thinking and ſober Men</hi> to do ſo and ſo. Sure this was ſome <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Evening, when the Gentlemen were got to ſtill Muſick, and therefore they <hi>proteſted ſilently,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe any Man that ſpoke was to be ſmutted. Pray, Sir, did this Silence invade your Ears at a diſtance? or were you of the Company? Durſt they play with ſo merry a Gentleman, when there was ſuch a Penalty upon Laughing? The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal you tell us of, would have ſent the Cork quite round the Company: for what can be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, than for ſober and thinking Men to reſolve and proteſt ſo ſolemnly, That if ever their Church 'ſcap'd the Papiſts, they would be ſure to give it up to the Fanaticks. I ſuppoſe, Your <hi>Head has as much room in it as the Weſtern Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> and ſome to ſpare; and undoubtedly there was the Meeting when this tacit Agreement was reſolv'd upon. Could not you leave it a tacit one, as they made it? They'll remove their Club to another Houſe if they know you blab thus; or it may be they'll diſperſe, and then how ſhall we rally 'em to make good their Bargain and Sale? You muſt lie down again and think, and put up
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152739:8"/>
a Bill upon your Forehead to give notice that your Head's ready, and there is not ſo fit a Place in <hi>England</hi> for 'em to meet in: but if they ſhould not come, becauſe the Room's unfurniſh'd, don't you grow angry with the whole Church, and fret and fume, and cry, <hi>Tricks, Cheats, no Body</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 29.</note> 
               <hi>will trust 'em more.</hi> It would better become your Character to fawn upon 'em, if you thought them ſo like your Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>Another Argument is, The King will reſent <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 24.</note> our Refuſal. I believe this Secret was reveal'd to you in a ſecond Fit of Thinking; for I don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your Name in the Liſt of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and ſo there's hopes you may ſpeak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Commiſſion. To be plain with you, you altering comprehending Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> take too much upon you, making bold with the King's Name upon every Occaſion, and pretending ſuch an intimate Acquaintance with things ſo far out of your reach. You make the King but a ſcurvy Complement, when you trump up that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him which ſounded ſo harſh in the late Reign. The reſt of the Clergy have more juſt and honorable Thoughts of him: they rely upon his Word, and after ſo many repeated Aſſurances of his Gracious Inclinations towards them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not queſtion but the Church ſhall continue ſafe and quiet under his Protection, and happy in his Favor.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:152739:8"/>
            <p>You may chance to be as much deceiv'd in <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 24.</note> your Opinion of the Parliament, ſince the better part of the Members are as averſe to Alterations as we are. Except in your Book, I never heard that they ſet the Convocation about that Work; but <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 24.</note> in Sixty One they made an Act to eſtabliſh the Liturgy as it is, and that we deſire to ſtick to, at leaſt till they alter their Mind. Give us leave, Sir, to ſtay their time; and when they ſignifie their Pleaſure, we ſhall know our Duty without conteſting who are <hi>fitteſt Judges of Expedience.</hi> You need not doubt it, Sir, you have ſecur'd the Point, by aſſuring us that otherwiſe the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will turn the <hi>Convocation</hi> into <hi>Surgeons-Hall;</hi> and then what a Figure our Church will make? For if we won't leave out the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> there is no remedy but the <hi>Houſe</hi> muſt reſolve into a <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Phyſicians,</hi> and ſend for <hi>Surgeons</hi> to cut up <hi>Tobit</hi>'s Dog immediately. Shan't they be Barber-Surgeons, Sir? for then they may ſhave Religion too? Well 'tis a heavy Doom this: Pray Mr. <hi>T—m</hi> ſtay a little; the Gentleman may come to ſome Temper with the Dog; for he looks as if he might be perſuaded to come over a Stick for the King.</p>
            <p>I profeſs, Sir, I am mightily taken with this turning the Clergy into Surgeons, 'tis ſo proper a Metamorphoſis for the Miniſters of a <hi>Perſecuting</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 32.</note>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:152739:9"/>
               <hi>Church.</hi> Now let 'em cut, and lance, and cup, and ſcarifie tender Conſciences without mercy, as long as 'tis in their Vocation, but it did not ſo well become 'em when they had their Caſſocks on. And pray, Sir, tell me, were they all tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into Surgeons? No, no, a <hi>double majority</hi>—<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> why thoſe were <hi>the Longitudinarians;</hi> Ay, ſo they were, and therefore were turn'd into little ſhort <hi>Puppets</hi> of about an Inch; and a <hi>huge diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented</hi>
